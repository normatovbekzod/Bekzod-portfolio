Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio where I showcase my various projects ranging from my university's library data occupancy analysis to vizualizing HIV incidence data. 

# [Project 1: Analyzing library data occupancy data](https://github.com/normatovbekzod/library_data_analysis)
## Aim: 
### Analyze Yale-NUS library occupancy data in order to reveal insights into when the library is the busiest and which sections of the library are under-used.
## Objectives:
 - create a data collection method that can be used by students working for the library
 - clean data using R
 - prepare data for analysis by exporting it in excel format
 - analyze occupancy data using excel and R
 - data vizualizations using excel
 - a monthly report with key insights and findings
 - find out which library areas are under-used by analyzing the popularity of each seat (based on occupancy count)
 
## Data collection
Data is collected hourly during library opening hours by students working for the library by manually filling in the qualtrics form. This data collection method is secure as only those with password to the form could collect data; however, it is also prone to human errors. The dataset is also secure on the qualtrics website and raw data could be downloaded in the csv format. 

## Data processing
In order to process raw data, R was used. Data processing step involvs declaring a number of functions that help turn raw data into proper and easily understandable parameters. This step involved handling missing data, checking for outliers, which usually indicated a human error during data collection and checking for duplicates. Processed data was then exported into the excel file.

## Data Analysis and Vizualizations
Data analysis involved performing a number of EDAs and vizualizing occupancy counts in various sections of the library throughout the day and how some of the metrics such as average occupancy on weekends and weekdays compares to other months.

## Reporting and Actions
Main insights and vizualizations are included in a monthly report prepared at the start of following month. This report is saved in the Microsoft word format and shared with the library managers. 



# Project 2: Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews using nltk data
I used text mining together with machine learning techniques to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. I was able to achieve an accuracy rate of 80.6%

# [Project 3: Data visualization of HIV incidence per 100000 in difference regions of Uzbekistan](https://github.com/normatovbekzod/hiv_by_uzb_region)
I have volunteered at the national AIDS and HIV center in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Through this expereince I had an opportunity of raising awareness of HIV prevelance in different parts of Uzbekistan and advocate for better transperancy and ananimity of the data on hiv infections.
